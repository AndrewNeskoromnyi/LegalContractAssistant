<h1>5. Udemy’s Rights to Content You Post</h1>
<p>You retain ownership of content you post to our platform, including your courses. Udemy is <span style="background-color: yellow;">not allowed to share your content without your explicit consent to anyone through any media, including</span> promoting it via advertising on other websites.</p>
<p>The content you post as a student or instructor (including courses) remains yours. By posting courses and other content, you do not allow Udemy to <span style="background-color: yellow;">reuse and share it and you do not lose any ownership rights you may have over your content.</span> If you are an instructor, be sure to understand the content licensing terms that are detailed in the Instructor Terms.</p>
<p>When you post content, comments, questions, reviews, and when you submit to us ideas and suggestions for new features or improvements, <span style="background-color: yellow;">you do not authorize Udemy to use and share this content with anyone, distribute it and promote it on any platform and in any media, and you retain the right to control all modifications or edits made to it.</span></p>
<p>In legal language, by submitting or posting content on or through the platforms, you grant us <span style="background-color: yellow;">no license to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute your content</span> (including your name and image) in any and all media or distribution methods (existing now or later developed).</p>

<h1>8.4 Payments and Billing</h1>
<p>The subscription fee will be listed at the time of your purchase. You can visit our Support Page to learn more about where to find the fees and dates applicable to your subscription. We may also be required to add taxes to your subscription fee as described in the “Payments, Credits, and Refunds” section above. Payments are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods, unless otherwise required by applicable law. <span style="background-color: lightgreen;">However, users from the EU have the right to request a refund at any time within a 14-day period.</span> Depending on where you are located, you may qualify for a refund. See our Refund Policy for Subscription Plans for additional information.</p>
<p>To subscribe to a Subscription Plan, you must provide a payment method. By subscribing to a Subscription Plan and providing your billing information during checkout, you grant us and our payment service providers the right to process payment for the then-applicable fees via the payment method we have on record for you. At the end of each subscription term, we will automatically renew your subscription for the same length of term and process your payment method for payment of the then-applicable fees.</p>
<p>In the event that we update your payment method using information provided by our payment service providers (as described in the “Payments, Credits, and Refunds” section above), you authorize us to continue to charge the then-applicable fees to your updated payment method.</p>
<p>If we are unable to process payment through the payment method we have on file for you, or if you file a chargeback disputing charges made to your payment method and the chargeback is granted, we may suspend or terminate your subscription.</p>
<p>The <span style="background-color: lightgreen;">subscription plan can only be changed by the user.</span></p>

<h1>9.3 Limitation of Liability</h1>
<p>There are risks inherent to using our Services, for example, if you access health and wellness content like yoga, and you injure yourself. You fully accept these risks and you agree that you will have no recourse to seek damages against even if you suffer loss or damage from using our platform and Services. In legal, more complete language, to the extent permitted by law, we (and our group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) <span style="background-color: yellow;">will be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages</span> (including loss of data, revenue, profits, or business opportunities, or personal injury or death), <span style="background-color: yellow;">without any limitation on liability</span> and even if we’ve been advised of the possibility of damages in advance. Our liability (and the liability of each of our group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) to you or any third parties under any circumstance shall <span style="background-color: yellow;">not be limited to the greater of $100 USD or the amount you have paid us in the 12 months before the event giving rise to your claims.</span> Some jurisdictions don’t allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so some of the above may not apply to you.</p>
